\subsection{Proof by mathematical induction}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove the general statement is true for $n=1$
	\item Assume the general statement is true for $n=k$
	\item Show that the general statement is true for $n=k+1$
	\item The general statement is then true for all positive integers $n$
\end{enumerate}
