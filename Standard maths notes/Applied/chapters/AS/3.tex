\section{Outliers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An extreme value that lies outside the overall pattern of data
    \item By default use $\text{LB} = \LQ - 1.5\times(\UQ-\LQ)$, $\text{UB} = \UQ + 1.5\times(\UQ-\LQ)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Cleaning data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Anomalies (\textbf{not all outliers}) should be removed
    \item Anomalies = when the outlier is clearly an error and will be misleading
\end{itemize}


\section{Histogram}
\subsection{Reasons for using histograms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data is continuous
    \item Data is in groups (with uneven widths)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Characteristics of histograms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{area}\propto\text{frequency}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparing data sets}
\begin{description}
    \item[Comparing location] A has a higher median / mean than B on average so A is ... than B on average
    \item[Comparing spread] A has a higher IQR / standard deviation than B so there is more variation in the \dots of A than B
\end{description}
