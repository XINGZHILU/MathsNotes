\section{Populations and samples}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{description}
	\item[Population] The whole set of items that are of interest
	\item[Census] Observes or measures every member of a population
	\item[Sample] A selection of observations taken from a subset of the population which is used
	\item[Sampling unit] Individual units of a population that cam be sampled
	\item[Sampling frame] A list of all people or item that can potentially be involved in the sample
\end{description}

\subsection{Census}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gives a completely accurate result, no bias
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time consuming and expensive
	\item Cannot be used when the testing process destroys the item
	\item Hard to process large quantity of data
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sample}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Easier to implement
	\item Quicker to implement
	\item Less data to process
	\item Cheaper to implement
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The data may not be representative
	\item The sample may not be large enough to give information about small sub-groups of the population
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sample size}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Larger sample size = better accuracy
	\item If the population is varied a larger sample size is needed to make sure that the sample is representative
\end{itemize}


\section{Random sampling methods}
\subsection{Simple random sampling}
\textbf{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Every possible sample of size $n$ has an \textbf{equal chance} of being picked
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each sampling unit is numbered from 1 to $n$
	\item Generate $x$ random number between 1 to $n$ using random number generators / lottery picks / random number tables (or draw out $x$ names from the lottery hat), ignoring repeats
	\item Sampling units corresponding to these numbers become the sample
	\item Data taken from the sample
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Free of bias
	\item Easy and cheap to implement for small populations and small samples
	\item Each sampling unit has a known and equal chance of selection
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not suitable when the population size or the sample size is large as it is potentially time consuming, disruptive and expensive
	\item A sampling frame is needed
	\item Chance of being unrepresentative
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Systematic sampling}
\textbf{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The required elements are chosen at \textbf{regular intervals} from an \textbf{ordered list}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The population is ordered with a unique number each from 1 to $n$
	\item Required elements are chosen at regular intervals i.e. take every $k$th elements where $k=\dfrac{\text{Population size}}{\text{Sample size}}$
	\item Starting at random item between 1 and $k$ using a random number generator
	\item Take that item and select the remaining data at the chosen interval
	\item[*] \textbf{Show working}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simple and quick to use
	\item Suitable for large samples and large populations
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A sampling frame is needed
	\item It can introduce bias if the sampling frame is not random
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Stratified sampling}
\textbf{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The population is divided into mutually exclusive strata and a random sample is taken from each
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Population divided into \textbf{non-overlapping} groups / strata
	\item Same proportion ($\dfrac{\text{Sample size}}{\text{Population size}}$) sampled from each strata (\textbf{show working} for the total population and the size of each strata individually, round if needed)
	\item Simple random sampling carried out in each group (explain in more details here)
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample accurately reflects the population structure
	\item Guarantees proportional representation of groups within a population
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Population must be clearly classified into distinct strata
	\item Selection within each stratum suffers from the same disadvantages as simple random sampling
\end{itemize}
\section{Non-random sampling methods}
\subsection{Quota sampling}
\textbf{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Population divided into groups according to a given characteristic
	\item A quota group is set to try and reflect the group's proportion in the whole population
	\item An interviewer or researcher selects a sample that reflects the characteristics of the whole population (opportunity sampling)
	\item[*] \textbf{Show working}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows a small sample to still be representative of the population
	\item No sampling frame required
	\item Quick, easy, inexpensive
	\item Allows for easy comparison between different groups of population
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-random sampling can introduce bias
	\item Population must be divided into groups, which can be costly or inaccurate
	\item Increasing scope of study increases number of groups, adding time or expense
	\item Non-responses are not recorded
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Opportunity / convenience / pragmatic sampling}
\textbf{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sample taken from people who are available at time of study and meet the criteria
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to carry out
	\item No sampling frame required
	\item Inexpensive
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Likely to be unrepresentative
	\item Highly dependent on individual researcher (likely to be biased)
\end{itemize}

\end{description}





\chapter{Representations of data}
\section{Outliers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An extreme value that lies outside the overall pattern of data
	\item By default use $\text{LB} = \LQ - 1.5\times(\UQ-\LQ)$, $\text{UB} = \UQ + 1.5\times(\UQ-\LQ)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Cleaning data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Anomalies (\textbf{not all outliers}) should be removed

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Characteristics of histograms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\text{area}\propto\text{frequency}$

\section{Comparing data sets}
\begin{description}
	\item[Comparing location] A has a higher median / mean than B on average so A is ... than B on average

	\item $a=\overline{y}-b\overline{x}$
	\item Positive correlation: $b$ positive, negative correlation: $b$ negative
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Predicting values}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Should not extrapolate, only do interpolation
	\item Reliability: reliable as it is within the range of data / not reliable as it is extrapolating
	\item[$\star$] Not suitable for predicting $x$ based on $y$ (the independent variable in this model is $x$, you should not use this model to predict the value of $x$ based on $y$)
\end{itemize}

			0.1 & x=1, 2\\
			0.4 & x=3, 4\\
			0 & x=\text{anything else}

	\item[Significance level ($\alpha$)] Probability of rejecting $H_0$ when assuming $H_0$ is true
	\item[Critical region] A region of the probability distribution which, if the test statistic falls within it, would cause you to reject the null hypothesis
	\item[Critical value] The first value to fall inside the critical region / a value that is compared to the test statistic to determine whether to reject $H_0$
	\item[Acceptance region] The rejection region for $H_1$ in the testing of a hypothesis
	\item[Actual significance level] The probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (when $H_0$ is actually true)
\end{description}

\section{Test on proportion / probability of success assuming binomial distribution}
$t^*$ = test statistics
\subsection{By critical value}
\begin{itemize}
	\item One tailed: if stats test $t^* > \text{cv}$ or $t^* < \text{cv}$ (depends on right / left tail): reject $H_0$, else accept $H_0$
	\item Two tailed: if stats test $t^* > \text{upper cv}$ or $t^* < \text{lower cv}$: reject $H_0$, else accept $H_0$ (For 2 tailed tests the probability used for calculating cv at the end of each tail = $\dfrac{\alpha}{2}$)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{By $p$ value}
\begin{itemize}
	\item One tailed: if $P(t\geq t^*) < \alpha$: reject $H_0$, else accept $H_0$
	\item Two tailed: if $P(t\geq t^*) < \dfrac{\alpha}{2}$ or $P(t\leq t^*) > \dfrac{\alpha}{2}$: reject $H_0$, else accept $H_0$
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
	\subsection{Presenting the solution}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Define the test statistic, $X$ and the parameter, $p$
		\item Formulate a model for $X$ ($X \sim B(n, p)$)
		\item Write down $H_0$ and $H_1$ as statements involving $p$ (these determine whether your test is one or two-tailed)
		\item Specify the significance level
		\item Decide whether to reject $H_0$ by comparing $t^*$ to critical value or finding the probability of $t^*$ taking $x$ or a more extreme value
		\item State your conclusion: there is / is not sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ + a statement \textbf{in the context of the question}
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{comment}


\section{Two tailed tests}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Halve the significance value to find out the critical region at each end unless otherwise specified
	\item Notice if the question asks for the probability in each tail to be \textbf{as close to $\dfrac{\alpha}{2}$ as possible}
	\item Always use 2 tailed tests if whether testing for increase / decrease in $p$ is not specified
\end{itemize}

\section{Example responses}
\subsection{One tailed + critical region}
\begin{example}
	A single observation is taken from $X\sim B(10, p)$ and $x=1$ is obtained. Use this value to test $H_0: p=0.4$ against $H_1:p<0.4$ using a $5\%$ significance level
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
	$H_0: p=0.4$\\
	$H_1:p<0.4$\\
	Test statistic: $x=1$\\
	$\text{Significance level} = 5\%$\\
	One-tailed test\\
	$P(X \leq c_1) < 0.05$\\
	$P(X \leq 1) = 0.0463$ ($P(X \leq 2) = 0.1672$ too big)\\
	$c_1 = 1$ so critical region is $X\leq 1$\\
	$x=1$ lies in the critical region, so evidence suggests rejecting $H_0$ at $5\%$ significance level
\end{solution}

\subsection{One tailed + $p$ value}
\begin{example}
	A single observation is taken from $X\sim B(10, p)$ and $x=5$ is obtained. Use this value to test $H_0: p=0.25$ against $H_1:p>0.25$ using a $5\%$ significance level
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
	$H_0: p=0.25$\\
	$H_1:p>0.25$\\
	Test statistic: $x=5$\\
	$\text{Significance level} = 5\%$\\
	One-tailed test
	\begin{align*}
		P(X\geq 5) &= 1-P(X\leq 4) \\ &= 0.0781
	\end{align*}
	Compare $p$-value with significance level: $0.0781 > 0.05$\\
	It is not significant so no evidence to reject $H_0$ at the 5\% significance level
\end{solution}

\subsection{Two tailed - find critical region when using `probability as close to'}
\begin{example}
	$Y \sim B(25, p)$, given that $H_0: p=0.42$, $H_1:p \neq 0.42$, find the critical region for the test using $10\%$ significance level, \textbf{the probability in each tail should be as close to $5\%$ as possible}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
	$P(Y\leq c_1)$ as close to 0.05 as possible\\
	$P(Y\leq 6) = 0.0495 < 0.05$ - closest to $0.05$ so $c_1 = 6$\\
	$P(Y\leq 7) = 0.1106 > 0.05$\\\\
	
	$P(Y\geq c_2)$ as close to 0.05 as possible $\rightarrow$ $1-P(Y\leq c_2 -1)$ as close to 0.05 as possible $\rightarrow$ $P(Y\leq c_2 -1)$ as close to 0.95 as possible\\
	$P(Y\leq 14) = 0.9465 < 0.95$ - closest to $0.05$ so $c_2 = 14+1 = 15$\\
	$P(Y\leq 15) = 0.19779 > 0.95$
\end{solution}
