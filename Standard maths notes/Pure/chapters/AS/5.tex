\section{Straight line graphs}
\subsection{Finding equation of graphs}
$\dfrac{y-y_1}{y_2-y_1}=\dfrac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1}$

\subsection[]{*Distance from a point to a line}
$d=\dfrac{|ax_0+by_0+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$\\

\section{Modelling with linear equations}
\subsection{Commenting on validity for very large / small values}
Think about:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The range of values that the data has (is it including very large / small values?)
    \item What may happen as value becomes very small / large (is it realistic?)
\end{enumerate}
