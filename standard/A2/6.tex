\section{Assumptions}
\subsection{Modelling as particle}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All of the weight act at one point (specify the point)
    \item Air resistance can be ignored
    \item Any rotational forces can be ignored
\end{itemize}

\section{Equation of projectiles}
\begin{description}
    \item[Time of flight (back to the released height)] $T=\frac{2U\sin\alpha}{g}$
    \item[Time to reach the greatest height] $\frac{U\sin\alpha}{g}$
    \item[Range on horizontal plane] $\frac{U^2\sin 2\alpha}{g}$
    \item[Greatest height reached] $\frac{U^2\sin^2\alpha}{2g}$
    \item[Equation of trajectory] $y=x\tan\alpha - gx^{2}\frac{\left(1+\tan^2\alpha\right)}{2U^2}$ 
\end{description}

\section{Model limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Approximate value of $g$ have been used
    \item Dimensions of the stone can affect its motion
    \item $g$ has been assumed to be constant
    \item Effect of wind is ignored
    \item Spin of the stone ignored
    \item Surface area of the ball ignored / dimensions of the ball ignored / ball modelled as particle
    \item Air resistance ignored
\end{itemize}
