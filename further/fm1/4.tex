\section{Newton's law of restitution}
\begin{description}
    \item[Particles colliding:] $e=\frac{\text{speed of separation of particles}}{\text{speed of approach of particles}}$
    \item[Direct collision with a smooth plane:] $e=\frac{\text{speed of rebound}}{\text{speed of approach}}$
    \item[Range of $e$:] $0 \leq e \leq 1$
\end{description}

\section{Loss of kinetic energy}
Loss of kinetic energy due to impact = $(\frac{1}{2}m_1u_1^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2u_2^2)-(\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2)$

\section{Problems with modelling} % might need some more work here
\begin{description}
    \item[Bouncing for an infinite number of times:] the ball should stop bouncing after a finite number of bounces
    \item[Spheres modelled as particles:] air resistance is ignored
\end{description}
